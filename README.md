# duotransits

Data reduction: going from getting feasible targets from the TOI catalogue to getting aliases for each target, to scheduling observations.

add: information about transits, duotransits, TESS, creating aliases to find orbital periods.

## TOIcatalogue
This folder shows the process of reducing the TESS Objects of Interest (TOI) catalogue to get a list of duotransits (targets with two observed transits) observable from the Windmill Hill Observatory at the University of Warwick. Reducing the data from 6739 candidates to only 10 possible targets (Dataset from https://tev.mit.edu/data/collection/193/). 

## example
This folder contains a notebook going through the process for obtaining aliases for a TESS object of interest (in this code TIC26547036). 

## solvedTIC276376289 - the solved system
This folder contains a notebook going through the same process, here I have shown the system I solved, finding the orbital period for the target (TIC276376289). Further observations of the planet-star system can help confirm this prediction and the target can move closer to being confirmed as an exoplanet.
